### üåä Mod Digest - First Half of Summer 2025 [2025.07.21]

![Banner for Another Tank Mod and ExRoulette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/ComModNews/main/assets/atm_exroulette.png)

Once again, we welcome you to learn about the latest and greatest in Ex Machina modding scene. Summer is usually a dry season for game releases, but modders have their own rules. In just two months since the last digest, a whole bucket of mods in various genres have been released:
* **[ExRoulette](https://forum.deuswiki.com/t/exroulette/3060/1)** can hardly be even called a total conversion mod, its more of a new small game based on the Miracle3D engine, inspired by Buckshot Roulette (and Russian roulette as the concept). If Armada or [Escape from Apocalypse](https://forum.deuswiki.com/t/escape-from-apocalypse/3028/1) failed to surprise you with their genre tricks, then maybe "roulette" will! *(Author: E Jet)*
* **[ATM ‚Äî Another Tank Mod [RU only]](https://forum.deuswiki.com/t/atm-another-tank-mod/3065/1)** - adds a new fully playable tank called Chieftain to the game, tailored to the realities of the game. This is not the first mod for tracked vehicles, but it is pleasing in how neatly the new content has been integrated into the game. *(Author: funnyscout)*
* **„ÄΩÔ∏è** **[MoreAmmo](https://github.com/FlyApp1e/MoreAmmo)** - instead of using the same ammunition for all gun types, the mod features about 10 different calibers of bullets, cartidges and shells with different costs - and all the guns have also have a limited ammunition. *(Author: FlyApple)*
* **‚ìÇÔ∏è** **[JustAnotherBalanceMod (JABM)](https://github.com/FlyApp1e/HTA-JustAnotherBalanceMod)** - a mod that changes the balance of prices in the game, with the aim of preventing players from accumulating millions in capital by the middle of the game. In combination with MoreAmmo, it significantly reshapes the economy. *(Author: FlyApple)*

You've probably noticed the **„ÄΩÔ∏è** icon next to the names of the two mini-mods. This means that they are packaged as "merge-mods", i.e., using a system that allows mod resources to be merged with game files. Such mods are much more likely to be compatible with other mods and can be installed on top of different mod configurations. This system still currently has some limitations, so pay attention to the authors' notes about which mods their merge mods are compatible with.

In addition to new releases, several updates have also been released, some of which are quite significant:
* **[Escape from Apocalypse (Update 0.95) [RU only]](https://forum.deuswiki.com/t/escape-from-apocalypse/3028/15)** - new mechanics, items, quests, and many other changes, as well as a new, as always, awesome stylish video explaining the mod's mechanics (link below)
* **[The Chronicle of Hamza 1.1.2](https://forum.deuswiki.com/t/the-chronicle-of-hamza/3038/7)** - now with many bug fixes and improvements, this story mod is still worthy of your full attention. Mod is also now available in full English translation!
* **„ÄΩÔ∏è** **[ExtraMachines 2.0](https://forum.deuswiki.com/t/extramachines/2949/5)** has moved to a merge-mod system and is now compatible with a large number of other mods, with various bug fixes as a bonus
* **„ÄΩÔ∏è** **[OverPhys 2.0](https://forum.deuswiki.com/t/overphys/2931/7)** is now compatible with a bunch of stuff, including Improved Storyline! An awesome way to get new experience from the game with the help of a new vehicle physics and more
* **[Absque nota 0.8.4](https://forum.deuswiki.com/t/absque-nota/2967/1)** has added even more new vehicles, weapons, textures, and bug fixes in the last two versions

We don't want to clutter up this resulting mega-digest with unnecessary information, so we'll just note that to install merge mods, you'll need the latest version of ComMod, no older than 3.0.6 ‚Äî we recommend updating if you're still using an older version.

* üü† **You can get up-to-date ComMod 3.0.6** [on our Github](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/releases), and compatible mods on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/deus-ex-machina-522817939616038912) or [our new forum](https://forum.deuswiki.com/mods)

### üå± Mod-digest - Spring 2025 [2025.05.16]

![Banner for apaTche and The Chronicle of Hamza](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/ComModNews/main/assets/apatche_hamza.png)

Hi HardTruckers! This spring is so abundant with releases that the banner has to be shared by two mods at once, each worthy of it on its own. Moreover, the only thing that saved us from getting a third mod in there is its ‚Äúbeta‚Äù status. It's great to have such problems facing the upcoming 20th anniversary of the series, don't ya think?

New releases:
* **[apaTche](https://forum.deuswiki.com/t/apatche/3044/1)** - first ever major mod for Ex Machina: Arcade, that aims to fix lots of gameplay and visual issues to make it a much more fun and consistent experience, also bringing full English support complete with voiceover to the game
* **[The Chronicle of Hamza](https://forum.deuswiki.com/t/the-chronicle-of-hamza/3038/1)** - new story mod, unfolding in the desert region, the main character Hamza along with his friend Mansur and the original game's protagonist, must uncover the causes of the 2011 catastrophe [RU-only, ENG in development]

New beta release:
* **[Escape from Apocalypse](https://forum.deuswiki.com/t/escape-from-apocalypse/3028/1)** - author will modestly tell you that this is ‚Äúa mod that aims to port all possible mechanics and game experience from Escape from Tarkov‚Äù. In fairness, it is a unique and technically impressive extraction-survival, unlike any other mod for the game [RU only]

[![Screens of all three mods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/ComModNews/main/assets/triple_trouble_screens.webp)](https://forum.deuswiki.com/c/mods/9)


With such a lineup of releases, one can guess one more new feature.... ComMod, starting with version 3.0, supports Arcade and Meridian 113! There are no compatible releases for M113 yet, but when installing apaTche ComMod will take care to apply small memory allocation edits to the engine, ported from ComPatch, significantly reducing the chances of crashes and allowing those who had previously had problems running the game to launch it.

For modders, 3.0+ adds features that will allow mods to become much more compatible with each other. This will require updating existing mods, so hopefully modders will be interested in this feature.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/ComModNews/main/assets/armada.png" alt="Logo" width="800">
HTA mod released today is probably "the coolest of the weird ones" and "the weirdest of the cool ones" - ARMADA.
Or as its author modestly but accurately describes it sometimes: "mod with ships".
Below a reminder with the trailer for this, in fact, the first mod that can be called a total-conversion based on HTA engine. I don't know what else there is to say. You just have to play it, especially since it supports English on release!

Take note: **this mod requires the latest ComMod 2.1 and ComRem 1.14.1**, links are available in the news below!
