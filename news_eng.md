### üõ≥Ô∏è Armada mod is now out - "HTA mod with ships" [2024.04.04]
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/ComModNews/main/assets/armada.png" alt="Logo" width="800">
HTA mod released today is probably "the coolest of the weird ones" and "the weirdest of the cool ones" - ARMADA.
Or as its author modestly but accurately describes it sometimes: "mod with ships".
Below a reminder with the trailer for this, in fact, the first mod that can be called a total-conversion based on HTA engine. I don't know what else there is to say. You just have to play it, especially since it supports English on release!

Take note: **this mod requires the latest ComMod 2.1 and ComRem 1.14.1**, links are available in the news below!
