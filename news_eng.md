### üõ≥Ô∏è Armada mod is now out - "HTA mod with ships" [2024.04.04]
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/ComModNews/main/assets/armada.png" alt="Logo" width="800">
HTA mod released today is probably "the coolest of the weird ones" and "the weirdest of the cool ones" - ARMADA.
Or as its author modestly but accurately describes it sometimes: "mod with ships".
Above I remind you how the trailer of this, in fact, the first mod that can be called a total-conversion based on HTA engine looked like. I don't know what else there is to say. You just have to play it, especially since it supports English on release!

Take note: **this mod requires the latest ComMod 2.1 and ComRem 1.14.1**, links are avaiable in the news below!

### üî• First official English release of Community Remaster - 1.14.1! New ComMod 2.1! [2024.04.03]

New version of Community Remaster has been released, this is the first official release of ComRem and ComPatch with English support!
In addition, a small bug added in the last version has been fixed.

ComRem itself in this release was ported to the latest version of ComMod 2.1, which contains a huge number of internal improvements and greatly increases the convenience of work for modders. For example, it is now possible to distribute different versions of your mod in one archive without file duplication.
For players, this release is important because it unties our hands and allows us to work on the next full-fledged version of the mod. Stay tuned!

‚ùóInstallation of the new ComRem will only be possible with ComMod 2.1, new versions of other mods will also often use its new features, so be sure to upgrade to the latest version!

You can download mod on our Github: [CommunityRemaster 1.14.1](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/blob/main/README_EN.md)
