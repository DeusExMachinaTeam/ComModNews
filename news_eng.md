### üå± Mod-digest - Spring 2025 [2025.05.16]

![Banner for apaTche and The Chronicle of Hamza](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/ComModNews/main/assets/apatche_hamza.png)

Hi HardTruckers! This spring is so abundant with releases that the banner has to be shared by two mods at once, each worthy of it on its own. Moreover, the only thing that saved us from getting a third mod in there is its ‚Äúbeta‚Äù status. It's great to have such problems facing the upcoming 20th anniversary of the series, don't ya think?

New releases:
* **[apaTche](https://forum.deuswiki.com/t/apatche/3044/1)** - first ever major mod for Ex Machina: Arcade, that aims to fix lots of gameplay and visual issues to make it a much more fun and consistent experience, also bringing full English support complete with voiceover to the game
* **[The Chronicle of Hamza](https://forum.deuswiki.com/t/the-chronicle-of-hamza/3038/1)** - new story mod, unfolding in the desert region, the main character Hamza along with his friend Mansur and the original game's protagonist, must uncover the causes of the 2011 catastrophe [RU-only, ENG in development]

New beta release:
* **[Escape from Apocalypse](https://forum.deuswiki.com/t/escape-from-apocalypse/3028/1)** - author will modestly tell you that this is ‚Äúa mod that aims to port all possible mechanics and game experience from Escape from Tarkov‚Äù. In fairness, it is a unique and technically impressive extraction-survival, unlike any other mod for the game [RU only]

[![Screens of all three mods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/ComModNews/main/assets/triple_trouble_screens.webp)](https://forum.deuswiki.com/c/mods/9)


With such a lineup of releases, one can guess one more new feature.... ComMod, starting with version 3.0, supports Arcade and Meridian 113! There are no compatible releases for M113 yet, but when installing apaTche ComMod will take care to apply small memory allocation edits to the engine, ported from ComPatch, significantly reducing the chances of crashes and allowing those who had previously had problems running the game to launch it.

For modders, 3.0+ adds features that will allow mods to become much more compatible with each other. This will require updating existing mods, so hopefully modders will be interested in this feature.

### üõ≥Ô∏è Armada mod is now out - "HTA mod with ships" [2024.04.04]

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/ComModNews/main/assets/armada.png" alt="Logo" width="800">
HTA mod released today is probably "the coolest of the weird ones" and "the weirdest of the cool ones" - ARMADA.
Or as its author modestly but accurately describes it sometimes: "mod with ships".
Below a reminder with the trailer for this, in fact, the first mod that can be called a total-conversion based on HTA engine. I don't know what else there is to say. You just have to play it, especially since it supports English on release!

Take note: **this mod requires the latest ComMod 2.1 and ComRem 1.14.1**, links are available in the news below!
